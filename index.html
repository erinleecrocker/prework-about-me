      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I started out as a Graphic Designer. In the area of web design, I understood how to use different programs to create nice visuals but, I was frustrated by how little I understood about web development. My brother got an internship involving web development for a company and his work was very interesting to me.  Since I have the time and resources I want to learn more and transition into a career in web development. </p>
